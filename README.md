Starlark ⭐ meets Cadence ⚙️

Cadence Starlark Worker integrates Cadence Workflow with Starlark scripting language. It allows users to write workflows in Starlark, which are then run on Cadence without requiring worker redeployment. This approach enables flexible, multi-tenant workflow execution, combining Cadence's robustness with Starlark's simplicity and safety features.
